# Falldetection_using-EEG
Using the EEG signals we can create a model that can detect the fall in a human body , According to IEEE and the jeneroles it is believed that fall is one of the main reasonn for the injuries in the ealderly 
This model is based on the the project that uses a headworn wearable EEG devivce that feeeds in the live data from a person and the model gives out the pridiction of fall based on the reading 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////// DATA SET 

A dataset is test perpose data set is used having the eeg reading of individual momentes like walking , running and day today activity that is labeled as the fall and the non fall data respectively using the code given
