# Falldetection_using-EEG
Using the EEG signals we can create a model that can detect the fall in a human body , According to IEEE and the jeneroles it is believed that fall is one of the main reasonn for the injuries in the ealderly 
This model is based on the the project that uses a headworn wearable EEG devivce that feeeds in the live data from a person and the model gives out the pridiction of fall based on the reading 

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////// DATA SET 

The original data set. Contains the EEG data from 14 healthy people. The data set is converted into a CSV file having The signal points. Taken from the waveform and converted into CSV. Containing. 4750 rows And 56,000 columns. Followed by the label alpha, beta, Theta, delta that is converted into numeric form 0123.

The main idea is to detect fall unconscious state and deep sleep state that occurs in a human. From the statistics and from the doctors, it is stated that Delta wave is the main criteria to detect any kind of unconsciousness, deep sleep.
