The board is to 1st read the data. We have used a library nme to convert the original data set into CSV files. The original data set is shared in the repository.
After converting, we read the data using. PDdot read CSV although it uses a large amount of RAM but you can use it by using chunk size. Set chunk size to 1000 and it will work.
After which we have used Sk Learn Test SplitterIt has divided the data set into two sets. 1 is test set and the other is train set. The train set is 80% of the data.
After which we have. Separated the X component and the Y component as data and label. That is fed into a pipeline for. Standard scaler feature scaling. We need this feature scaling so that two classes. Fight each egg data correctly.
You have used a1 dimensional. Convolutional. Neural network. Through which we have attained. The accuracy of 99%.
